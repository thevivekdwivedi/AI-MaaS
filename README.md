# AI-MaaS
This project was created as a part of a Hackathon. It contains a web-app interface to a backend created in MySQL, Sequelize.js and Node.js and an R engine. The aim of the web-app is to provide a user-friendly interface to a complex engine that provides the cost-savings that could be generated if an organization were to subscribe to a particular Procurement solution.

As this project was developed aroud a novel code that isn't protected by law, it has been decided to not put it up on public space. Hence the engine developed in R is unavailable to the public. But the rest of the application is available free for use.
